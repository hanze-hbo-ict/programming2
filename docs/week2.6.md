# Week 2.6: SE4ML

## Introduction

During the plenary part, we have discussed some properties of good (and of bad) software. In the following assignments you are asked to use this information to analyze the code of one of your classrooms. Further, we will look at two articles that describe the necessity of Software Engineering practices for Machine Learning projects.

## Assignment 1: code review

For this assignment, you are given the code-base of one of your classmates. Analyse this code and write a small report with your findings. In this report, you should take the practices that have been described during the plenary part into consideration. 

For easy reference, the first four are repeated below â€“ those metrics pertain to the more basic architectural setup of the code base, which in general will suffice.

1. Write short units of code
2. Write simple unites of code
3. Write code once
4. Keep unit iterfaces small

Before this more concrete analyses, make sure you give a thorough desciption of the code base you received: what is it supposed to do, how well is it organized and how would it scale and be maintainable?

Also, provide at least one suggestion for a not trivial refactor. Make sure you describe the code as it is and why you propose this refactor. In what way will this improve the code base in your opinion?

## Assignment 2

Read the article [Software Engineering for Machine Learning: Characterizing and Detecting Mismatch in Machine-Learning Systems](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/software-engineering-for-machine-learning-characterizing-and-detecting-mismatch-in-machine-learning-systems/) by Lewis and Ozkaya (2021). Give a small summary of this article in which you describe the different types of mismatches the authors identify. Try to come up with concrete examples of these mismatches from your own projects and/or experience.

Read the article [Tackling Collaboration Challenges in the Development of ML-Enabled Systems](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/tackling-collaboration-challenges-in-the-development-of-ml-enabled-systems/) by Lewis (2023) and give a small summary of it. How do you envision your cooperation as (future) data scientist with software engineers? In what way will you make your code scalable, readable and maintainable? If you have ever put code in production, please descibe your experiences in doing so.
