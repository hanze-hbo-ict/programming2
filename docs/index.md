# Programming 2

These pages provide the materials, information, and assignments for the module *Programming 2* for the Master Digital Science for Life Science.

As its name suggests, this module is the follow-up of *Programming 1* and it builds on the tools and techniques that were used in that first module. It aims to make students competent in designing parallel solutions for computational problems that arenâ€™t adequately solvable by a single computer. In order to do so, we first refresh the topics of *Programming 1*, we look some more into object life-cycle and multiple class interaction. After this, we look into the Divide and Conquer and Map Reduce algorithms, which provides us the mindset of seperating our unit of work into several sub-problems, that can be easily distributed over several machines.

In the second part of this module, we will actually perform this distribution. We will talk at some length about parallelism and network operations. After that we will use systems such as Spark of Dask to run several analyses of complex data sets. We end the module by looking at best practices from sofware engineering to make our own code base better.

## Assignment

During the course, students will work individually on (more or less) weekly assignments. Every week, students are given time to work on these assignments and will give peer-feedback on each-other's work. Students can improve their elaboration on basis of this feedback. 

At the end of the term, the collection of all these elaborations will form a portfolio which will be graded. Should the portfolio be considered unsufficient, specific repair-assignments will be given.
