# Programming 4

These pages provide the materials, information, and assignments for the module *Programming 4* for the Master Digital Science for Life Science.

In this module, we look some more into object life-cycle and multiple class interaction. After this, we look into the Divide and Conquer and Map Reduce algorithms, which provides us the mindset of separating our unit of work into several sub-problems, that can be easily distributed over several machines.

## Assignment

During the course, students will work individually on (more or less) weekly assignments. Every week, students are given time to work on these assignments and will give peer feedback on each other's work. Students can improve their elaboration on basis of this feedback. 

At the end of the term, the collection of all these elaborations will form a portfolio which will be graded. Should the portfolio be considered insufficient, specific repair assignments will be given.
